We are releasing an online key check service at [https://factorable.net](https://factorable.net) that enables users to check public SSH host keys and TLS certificates against our known database of keys factorable RSA keys, known compromised DSA keys, Debian weak keys, and snake-oil keys. The service will also report whether we have seen the same key in use in other certificates or served from other IP addresses, which can help identify default or repeated keys.
