I am a research fellow and Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu) where my research focuses on network security. I am advised by [Professor J. Alex Halderman](https://jhalderm.com/) and funded by a [Google Ph.D. Fellowship](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/06/2014-google-phd-fellowships-supporting.html). I can be reached at [zakir@umich.edu](mailto:zakir@umich.edu) ([key](https://keybase.io/zakir)) or (224) 286-4210.

My recent research has included studies on [Internet-wide Scanning](https://zmap.io), the [HTTPS Ecosystem](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/https-imc13.pdf), weaknesses in [cryptographic keys](https://factorable.net) and protocols, and [network mismanagement](http://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/01_1_1.pdf). Most recently, I have also been involved with the study and cleanup of the [Heartbleed Vulnerability](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/heartbleed-imc14.pdf). I lead the [ZMap Internet Scanner](https://zmap.io) and [Internet-Wide Scan Data Repository](https://scans.io) projects.
